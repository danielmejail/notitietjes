Let $K$ be a field and let $\Sigma$ be the set of all irreducible monic
polynomials $f$ in one indeterminate with coefficients in $K$. Let $A$ be the
polynomial ring over $K$ generated by the indeterminates $x_f$, one for each
$f\in\Sigma$. Let $\frak a$ be the ideal of $A$ generated by the polynomials
$f(x_f)$ for all $f\in\Sigma$. Show that $\frak a\neq\generado 1$.

Let $\frak m$ be a maximal ideal of $A$ containing $\frak a$, and let
$K_1=A/\frak m$. Then $K_1$ is an extension field of $K$ in which each
$f\in\Sigma$ has a root. Repeat the construction with $K_1$ in place of $K$,
obtaining a field $K_2$, and so on. Let $L=\bigcup_{n\geq 1}\,K_n$. Then $L$ is
a field in which each $f\in\Sigma$ splits completely into linear factors. Let
$\algclos K$ be the set of all elements of $L$ which are algebraic over $K$.
Then $\algclos K$ is an algebraic closure of $K$.
